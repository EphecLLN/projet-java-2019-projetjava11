## Our project

Our project is a kind of budget management app of a household.

*Billfold IT* is a Java application that tracks the financial status of a household and its members.
By extension, it can also be used for a cohabitation between friends.

Data visualization will be done through the automatic generation of various graphics.
The project is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) and a database is present to store all of the users data.

## How to run it

In order to run it, you must first ensure that you have Java 13+ installed on your computer.

* If you're not sure, simply enter this command in your terminal and it will show you the most recent version of Java running on your computer : `javac --version`
* If you want more details, you can enter this command in your terminal to see all your Java installations (JRE, JDK, specific configuration for VM server, etc.): `java --version`

For the console part, simply launch the app in a terminal via this command: `java - jar billfold-it_v1.0.jar`.

For the GUI part, it's currently only  a "sketch" of what it will look like.
